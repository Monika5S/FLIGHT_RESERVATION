            <p>
                Germany is Europe’s largest economy. It is also the second most populous nation after Russia on the continent,
                 with a population of over 81.5 million. Its territory stretches from the North Sea and Baltic in the north to the Alps in the south. 
                The country is traversed by rivers like the Danube, Elbe, and Rhine.
                <br><br>
                Munich is home to Mediterranean-style cafes and beer halls. It is Germany’s unofficial southern capital where the world comes together to celebrate the famous Oktoberfest. 
                It has many magnificent art galleries and museums that give a character to its royal Bavarian heritage.
                <br><br>
                Germany is famous for its pretzels and sausages. Bread is a significant part of the meal along with meats like pork, 
                chicken or beef. The country produces over 1200 different types of pastries and rolls. German cheeses account for about a third of all the cheese produced in Europe. 
                Although wine is popular in many cities of Germany, it is known for its beer purity and consumption.
